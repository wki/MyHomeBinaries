--------[ Ideas for expanding easy

- easy sync [-n] [-v] [--git-status]
    * find "sync.ext" config file in config-dir or app-dir
    * check sync status between this app's repository and all others
    * sync files being different to this repository

- easy migration ...
    * DBIx::Class::Migration::Script
    * use model named 'DB' (unless explicitly given)
      alternative: search for a model that has a 'connect_info' key
                   in CONFIG_LOCAL_SUFFIX config-file

- easy deploy <system> [-n] [-v] [--status]
    * find "deploy_<system>.ext" config file in config-dir or app-dir
    * follow deploy instructions for every machine listed
    * TBD

- easy overview
    * sync overview + git status
    * db migration status
    * deployment status for every system


--------[ Tests needed

- unit tests (running on dev machine)
- integration/component tests (running on CI server or dev machine)
- acceptance tests (running on CI server or dev machine)
- deployment tests (running on deployment machines)


--------[ Scripts needed

?


--------[ Provisioning

- how to install/setup needed daemons? Puppet
- how to install perl modules? carton bundle


--------[ Order of deployment

- set "out of service page"
- maybe stop daemons (except web server)
- sync everything
- provisioning, perl modules
- run scripts, db migration, etc.
- deployment test
- stop "out of service page"
