# My Home Binaries #

just a silly collection of binaries, I like to share among different machines. All of these binaries reside in my $HOME/bin directory which is part of my search path.

These binaries include:

 * `make_pod.sh` creates .pdf Files from a series of .pm/.pod files
 * `update_minicpan.sh` updates my minicpan mirror
 * `check_ssl.sh` checks available ciphers for a given ssl server
 * `install_cpan_modules.sh` installs a collection of useful modules

The misc_apps directory contains some apps that may get installed
independently. `dzil install` is your friend :-)


more things will get added from time to time.
